          <p>Some of my univertity's clubs offered simple workshops in Affter Effects so I jumped on the oppurtunity and from that day I kept improving myself bit by bit.</p>

          <p>In the first Semester of my first year at university, an Algorithmic course we had called ALSDS required knowledge of the Pascal programing language as it was very similar to the algorithmic language.</p>

          <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> December 2019: Python Basics</h3>
          <p>I started learning Python during the winter break as a way to pass time and learn more about computer science, I slowly found myself mesmerized by the simplitcity and power Python scripting offers, as well as the wide selection of fields that I can tap into from the portal of Python. Till this day, I still believe that Python is the best programming language out there.</p>

          <p>This was very similar to the way I learned Pascal, it was a course requirement. However, I was really interested in the use of C in many technologies such as Arduinos</p>

          <p>Learning PyGame to me was a natural step to proceed Python basics, I made several games using it and the majority of them can be found on my Github: aymenkouah</p>

          <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> May 2020: Python GUI library "Tkinter"</h3>
          <p>After making games for a while, I decided to mix it up a bit and learn how to make GUIs in order to advance my level a bit more. Upon using this library, I picked up many other things along the way, such as the "sqlite3" library and the "requests" library, which allowed me to create and manage databases as well as use APIs in my projects, the best example wuld be a simple program that upon being provided with a country and a city, returns a short list of weather related information about the target in the present.</p>

          <p>I always wanted to make websites, this feeling along side the boredom caused by quarantine made me finaly start learning seriously, which was translated into real-life results such as this website and others that can all be found in my github: aymenkouah. I also picked up some JavaScript and learned a lot more about git and github as well as how github pages work. Totally worth the effort.   </p>
